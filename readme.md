# Wordlebot

Joshua Greenslade

## How to run

Boot up a new virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and the run python wordle.py

In the code, you can run the bot in 3 modes
* In manual, you make guesses(?)
* In interactive, the bot will take guesses for you, and you simply provide the response from Wordle
* In benchmark, the bot will run through all possible solutions, and save the number of guesses it took to a `results.json` file.
